## What I did
**Deomo: https://recordit.co/cXdWcj0ahV**
- Designed and built a single-page web application using __React__. Bootstrap the development with mature component library __Ant Design__. 
- Implemented the backend services based on __Spring Boot__ to support stay upload, delete, search, and reserve functionality. 
- Used __MySQL__ to store user-generated data, e.g. stay information and reservation history, and utilized __Google Cloud Storage__ to store media files for uploaded stays. 
- Created __geo index__ by __Elasticsearch__ to support geo-based stay search based on userâ€™s selected locations. 
- Implemented __token-based__ server-side user authentication based on the __Spring Security framework__. 
- Deployed the backend service to __Google App Engine__ for better scalability and reliability.
